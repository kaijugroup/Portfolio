# Portfolio

Hi!  Welcome to my portfolio.  As of this writing (October 20th, 2022) this is still a work in progress but here's what you can find so far:

Completed:
R/Scripts: A series of short scripts I've written in R for use in my mathematics classes at school.

In Progress:
Python/SmokeDetector: This is a dataset I found on Kaggle that shows a series of inputs from a smoke detector.  I'm creating a logistic regression algorithm that will be able to signal if the alarm should sound or not based on inputs.  I know there's a sci-kit learn function that will do this for me but I want to use it as a learning opportunity to work with pandas on a machine learning problem.  I'll probably implement the scikit-learn method in a python script I'll called easyway.py when I'm done with the main program.
